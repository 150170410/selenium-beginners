Learn Selenium using examples:
--------
Selenium lets you control the browser through a script. Selenium lets you interact with browsers in a manner similar to real users interacting with browsers. We present small code samples that help you learn selenium from scratch using Python. 

There are a series of example code which is some of the most commonly performed actions on a webpage like navigating to a URL, fill in the text, click buttons, hover over elements, choose drop downs, validate text, etc. We hope you can learn selenium quickly by following these example code

Motivation for creating this repository
--------
We noticed that people learning selenium think it would take a lot of effort and time and hence would never start learning it. This repository is a collection of a simple exercise that beginners can use to practice selenium using Python.

This code is a companion to a Selenium tutorial (aimed at newbies) we presented as part of the Mangaluru Software Testing Group. This page was created by Qxf2 Services (http://qxf2.com) and Mangalore Infotech (http://mangaloreinfotech.in/) to help testers practice Selenium. 

Qxf2 provides QA consultancy services for startups. If you found this repository useful, please let us know by giving us a star on GitHub.

SETUP:
--------
a. Install Python 2.x

c. Add both to your PATH environment variable

d. Install Selenium (pip install Selenium)

e. Download Geckodriver (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and add it to your PATH environment variable

Pro tip: Once you are setup, try your best to timebox each exercise to no more than 10-minutes. We recommend this tip for even rank beginners who know nearly nothing about Selenium and Python!
