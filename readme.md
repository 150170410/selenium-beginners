Learn Selenium using examples:
--------
We present small code samples that helps you learn selenium from scratch using Python. The examples here are simple and helps you perform many actions like navigating to a url, fill in text, click buttons, hover over elements, chose drop downs, validate text, etc.

--------
Why do this at all?
--------
Selenium lets you control the browser through a script. Selenium lets you interact with browsers in a manner similar to real users interacting with browsers. The exercise has a series of examples which are the most commonly performed actions on a webpage. By working through these examples, we hope you can learn selenium quickly.

Motivation for creating this repository
--------
We noticed that people learning selenium think it would take a lot of effort and would never start. This repository is a collection of simple exercise that beginners can do to learn selenium using Python.

This code is a companion to a Selenium tutoral (aimed at newbies) we presented as part of the Mangaluru Software Testing Group. This page was created by Qxf2 Services (http://qxf2.com) and Mangalore Infotech (http://mangaloreinfotech.in/) to help testers practice Selenium. Qxf2 provides QA consultancy services for startups. If you found this repository useful, please let us know by giving us a star on GitHub.

SETUP:
--------
a. Install Python 2.x

b. If you do not have it already, get pip

c. Add both to your PATH environment variable

d. Install Selenium (pip install Selenium)

e. Download Geckodriver (https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and add it to your PATH environment variable

Pro tip: Once you are setup, try your best to timebox each exercise to no more than 10-minutes. We recommend this tip for even rank beginners who know nearly nothing about Selenium and Python!

NOTE: To get the most out of these exercises, we think beginners should use an IDE (e.g.: Visual Studio Code), use git and use one git branch per challenge. These are peripheral habits to the main exercises but they will go a long way in making you more comfortable in working with code.
